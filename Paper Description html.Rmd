This paper looks at the polical echo chambers created in the family unit that add to increasing polarization. It is no secret that political polarization is one of the most divisive parts of American society, especially since the 1980s (Iyengar, Sood, and Lelkes 2012; Pew Research Center 2014). Therefore, it is worth looking at the various effects of polarization, specifically family socialization. The increased polarization has led to deepended partisanship within the family. This is found by comparing a 1965 Youth-Parent Political Socialization Panel data set to national surveys from 2015 and voter files from 2014 and 2016. More specifically, it is found that there are more copartisan couples and they pass their partisanship on to their offspring. Familial political agreement has increased in this age of polarization. Overall, the human tendency to avoid conflict results in partisan selection between spouses and the passing on of partisan tendencies to offspring.
